# MyCrypt
A minimalist text editor that saves files encrypted. I originally wrote this utility in C# but decided to write it in Java just for fun. It needs a little work but I use it regularly on my Linux machines.

I've been wanting to upload it to my GitHub account for some time but was waiting til it was less buggy. However, I'm applying for a job at keepersecurity.com and they asked for a sample of my work on GitHub, so here it is.
