# MyCrypt
A minimalist text editor that saves files encrypted. I originally wrote this utility in C# but decided to write it in Java just for fun. It needs a little work but I use it regularly on my Linux machines.

I've been wanting to upload it to my GitHub account for some time but was waiting til it was less buggy. I decided that making it open to all will give me a little incentive to clean it up.
